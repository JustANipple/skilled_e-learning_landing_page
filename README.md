## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwinCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Inline styling
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) - Build tool

### What I learned

I was confused about the illustration image that stands in nav, but is also in line with the title. I found a way to place it as a column in a grid, so it has enough space to show

### Useful resources

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) - Useful to build a good template to start with React, TypeScript and TailwindCSS. Also makes it easy to deploy on Vercel
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Awesome inline styling with tailwind that provides a lot of flexibility
